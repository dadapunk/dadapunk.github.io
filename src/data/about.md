# Intro

Sebastian lives with his partner, a translator and proofreader, and her cat. Before moving to Berlin, Sebastian enjoyed playing drums with a band and riding a (road) bike. Now he enjoys good food, beer and live music.

# Currently

At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthenaâ€™s stack.
